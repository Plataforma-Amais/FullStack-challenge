## Requisites <a name="requisites"></a>

**This is a second version:** this version follows up an initial project where students develop from scratch back-end API and front-end of a web app to sell... yes, you guessed it: beer. üç∫

- *Back-end:* usage of [**mySQL**](https://www.mysql.com/) was required. The group decided to use a services layer in architecture.  
We used [**Express**](https://expressjs.com/), [**JWT**](https://jwt.io/) for login management, [**BCrypt**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)) to encrypt passwords before storing in databse, and log and error handling middleware (by Phelipe Ohlsen, see contributors below).  
**Documentation** made with [**Swagger**](https://swagger.io) available at `localhost:3001/documentation`.

- *Front-end:* all elements built up using [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) and *React Context*, along with [*React Router*](https://reactrouter.com/).  
A simple **web chat** for clients and admins implemented with [**Socket.io**](https://socket.io/).
Visual design was not a requirement in itself but we agreed in using a colour scheme and a nice logo was created by *Daniel Jesus* (see contributors below).
  
**Set-up for current version:** the current version required a migration from mySQL to [**Sequelize**](https://sequelize.org/) to start with, so we had to create all Sequelize models and migrations before moving on to the actual requisites of the project.

**Requisites sum-up:**

- Improve existing features to allow clients to see their orders' status and admin users to change that status among three possible values
- Create a chat feature for clients to chat with the store:
  - each client only chats with the 'store' and all chats are private
  - admin users can see all chats and send messages to clients
  - mongoDB is required to store chats
- Back-end unit tests (we mainly used endpoint tests with Jest and Supertest to track coverage across architecture layers)

## What did I do? <a name="my_work"></a>
A bit of everything. Back-end implementation, refactoring and improvements, and a fair bulk of the back-end tests.  
The front-end React development (and hooks otimization) and styling (*work in progress*, by the way - logo design by our team member _Daniel Jesus_).

## Instructions <a name="instructions"></a>

**Clone** the repo or **download** the zip.

Go to the project folder and run `npm install`. (which means *Node.js* must be installed in your machine)

To start the **back-end**: go to *back-end* project folder and run `npm start`.   
> (**bonus**: check out the sexy documentation for the API at `localhost:3001/documentation`)

To start the **front-end**: go to *front-end* project folder and run `npm start`.  

To run **back-end tests** (with coverage report): go to *back-end* project folder and run `npm run test-coverage`.  

#### Important: mongoDB and mySQL services must be installed and active in your machine in order for DBs (thus the whole project) to work.
